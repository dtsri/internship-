**Insights observed through this EDA**

* A heatmap is used to visualize the correlation between area and ranks of the islands as that can be observed from the earlier steps and as they are the only numerical columns
* A pairplot is used for visualizing this relationship between the area of the islands and the ranks of the islands.
* Based on the grouped bar chart - Europe has a very large total area, primarily driven by the polar climate.
Asia also has a significant total area, mostly from the tropics climate.
North America shows substantial area in both polar and temperate climates, with a smaller contribution from tropics.
Oceania has considerable area in both tropics and temperate climates.
Africa's area comes entirely from the tropics. 
* The bar chart is helpful to visualize the largest islands with their ranks and the top three largest islands are - Greenland, New Guinea , Borneo
* The regions which are populated by the largest islands are Europe, Asia and North America.
* While some regions with large total areas (Europe, Asia, North America) have significant contributions from polar and tropics climates, it's not a simple one-to-one relationship for all regions.
* The distribution of island sizes within each region and climate also plays a role.
